# Rock-Paper-Scissors game

## About

This game was built upon the real-life game where 2 people have a battle with gestures.
To make this even more fun, you now have the opportunity to play against the "AI" computer.
This game is and will always be based on luck to win. Try your luck and make the choice of how many rounds you want to play!

Give it a try!

### Strategy

My strategy for the site was to provide content and ease of access to users who want to play a simple game and have fun by utilizing the key UX principles.
The website was made in a way to not overwelm the users with clean and ituitive information and navigation.

### Scope

In order to achieve the discovery and strategy goals, the following features were included in this release:

- Header to highlight the name of the game
- A button that is linked to the game's rule
- Two rectangles that shows information about the players
- A reset button that gives the user the chance to start the game from zero
- A head that indicate what to do and the result of the round
- Two sections that show the signs
- Two messages sections that appear after the user selected a sign
to informed in letters what signs have been selected from both competitors
- Footer that contains the copyright of the page
